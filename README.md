I developed a Video Courses application named "Easy Engineering" utilizing the Firebase Realtime Database with Instructor and Student signup-login.

Screen 1 - Welcome Page (Login & Signup)
Gives you option of Login and Signup as Instructor and Login as per choice.

Screen 2 - Add Video Course (Instructor Login)
After login as instructor, ADD video course details like coursename, price, details and upload video to database.

Screen 3 - Main Activity (Student Login)
After login as student, you will get three fragments as All courses, My Courses and Explore with sidemenu displaying your name and "logout" option at the topbar.

Fragment 1 - All Courses
All courses which are added by the instructor, will be seen here with coursename, price and Buy button.

Screen 4 - Checkout Page
By pressing on "buy" button, checkout page will be loaded and clicking on "checkout" button, course purchased successfully & redirected to All Courses Fragment automatically.

Fragment 2 - My Courses
All your purchases courses will be displayed here, with video play button and time limit and if the time left is completed, video will be locked and to again watch the video, you need to renew the course video by clicking on that icon. "Pay & Renew" options renews your video duration instantly. 

Screen 6 - Video Player
This loads your video after asking you whether to play the video "from the beginning" or "start over" and plays video after your selected choice, records your watch time, gives you "change orientation" option and pauses video automatically after your click back button."

Fragment 3 - Explore Fragment
this fragment is disabled for this app.
